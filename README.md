# useContext-Basics

**useContext-Basics** is a collection of three simple React projects that demonstrate how to use the `useContext` hook for global state management. Each mini-project focuses on a different real-world scenario: theme toggling, user authentication, and language selection.

## 📁 Projects

1. **ThemeToggle-Context**  
   Toggle between light and dark mode using `ThemeContext`.

2. **AuthContextDemo-Context**  
   Simulated login/logout functionality with `AuthContext`.

3. **LanguageSelector-Context**  
   Switch between different languages using `LanguageContext`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

  npm run dev
```

#### Example:

```bash
  cd ThemeToggle-Context

  npm run dev
```
